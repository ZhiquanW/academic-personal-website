title: Co-design of Virtual Creatures via Evolution
summary: |2-
  * Development of a virtual creature generator supporting random generation based on input rules and user constraints with Python.
  * Implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) on Pytorch for parallel training of arbitrary virtual creaturesâ€™ locomotion.
  * Proposed a novel pipeline for the parallel co-design of large-scale population creatures with evolutionary algorithm.
  * Doubled the performance of creatures in locomotion tasks while significantly reducing computational resources.
