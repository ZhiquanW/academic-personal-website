abstract: We have developed a modular virtual reality gaming application that can be used to synthesize exercise drills for racket sports. By defining cost terms that are related to the gameplay and the mechanics of the game, as well as by allowing a user to control the parameters of the cost terms, users can easily adjust the objectives and the intensity levels of the exercise drills. Based on the user-defined exercise objectives, a Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization method called “simulated annealing” was used to optimize the exercise drill. The effectiveness of the developed virtual reality gaming application was measured in two studies by using virtual reality table tennis as the evaluation tool. The first study investigated the potential usefulness of the developed virtual reality gaming application as an exercise tool by comparing its workout effectiveness at three intensity levels (low, medium, and high) through the collection of heart rate readings. The second study explored the potential utility of the virtual reality gaming application as a training tool by exploring whether there was any improvement in participants' performance across the three conditions (no training, virtual reality training, and real-world training). The results indicate that a virtual reality gaming application, such as the examined virtual reality table tennis exergame, could indeed be used effectively as both an exercise and a training tool. Limitations and future research directions are discussed further below.
