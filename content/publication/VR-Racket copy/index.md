abstract: "This paper presents an optimization-based approach for designing virtual reality game level layouts, based on the layout of a real environment. Our method starts by asking the user to define the shape of the real environment and the obstacles (e.g., furniture) located in it. Then, by representing a game level as an assembly of chunks and defining the game level layout design decisions in cost terms (mapping, fitting, variations, and accessibility) in a total cost function, our system automatically synthesizes a game level layout that fulfills the real environment layout and its constraints as well as the user-defined design decisions. To evaluate the proposed method, a user study was conducted. The results indicated that the proposed method: (1) enhanced the levels of presence; (2) enhanced the levels of involvement of participants in the virtual environment; and (3) reduced the fear of collision with the real environment and its constraints. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed."
