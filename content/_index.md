          #   ### Co-design of Virtual Creatures via Evolution
          #   * Development of a virtual creature generator supporting random generation based on input rules and user constraints with Python.
          #   * Implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) on Pytorch for parallel training of arbitrary virtual creaturesâ€™ locomotion.
          #   * Proposed a novel pipeline for the parallel co-design of large-scale population creatures with evolutionary algorithm.
          #   * Doubled the performance of creatures in locomotion tasks while significantly reducing computational resources.

          #     #### Bird Retina Droplet Detection
          #     * Developed a tool for data cleaning for an unorganized dataset with different resolutions, backgrounds, and formats.
          #     * Designed and implemented a bird retina droplet VGG - based detection model with high accuracy (86%) on average.
          #     * Deployed the detection model on a local machine, integrating it into an application for easy real-time result editing.
